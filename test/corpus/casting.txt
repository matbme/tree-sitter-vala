Static Type Casting
====================

float f = (float) i;

(source_file
    (declaration
        (primitive_type)
        (identifier)
        (static_cast (primitive_type) (identifier))
    )
)


=====================
Dynamic Type Casting
=====================

Button b = widget as Button;

(source_file
    (declaration 
        (camel_cased_identifier)
        (identifier)
        (dynamic_cast (identifier) (camel_cased_identifier))
    )
)
